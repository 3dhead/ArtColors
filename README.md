# ArtColors
Intuitive color mixing in subtractive Red-Yellow-Blue color space.  A traditional art school color wheel and palette selector provides triadic, split-complementary and tetradic color harmonies.  RGB-to-RYB conversion with simple formulas.  Built with RayLib.

# Uses
1. **Intuitive color mixing for graphic design, data visualization, GUI creation or video game graphics.**

   Everyone grows up learning that red and yellow make orange.  The RGB space is unintuitive.
   
2. **Easy generation of harmonious palettes for pleasing graphic design.**

   Color schemes in fine art are based on simple geometric relations on an RYB color wheel which has red, yellow and blue primaries 120 degrees apart.  The typical RGB color wheel has red, green and blue 120 degrees apart, so these color schemes cannot be easily employed.
   
3. **Portable simple formulas for RYB-to-RGB conversion and subtractive color mixing.**

   There is a lot of literature on subtractive color mixing.  My approach aims for a compromise between simplicity and accuracy, with much less code than a reflectance-based approach.
