# Roadmap for ArtColors

This first beta release is being pushed out quickly during midterm break.  Summer will give me more time for development.

## TO DO:
Refine palette hue spectrum a little more to get better color harmonies.
Calculate more exact inverse function for RGB-to-RYB.
Make a help file?
Add facility for choosing Colorblind-friendly palettes.

## Vestigal code
There's some functions I have commented out but work fine, like an alternative rectangular color picker.  Go ahead and play with them (if you can find a place for them on the screen!)

## Fixed in 0.1:
Screen shot button works correctly now.
