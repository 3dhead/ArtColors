# Roadmap for ArtColors

This first beta release is being pushed out quickly during midterm break.  Summer will give me more time for development.

## TO DO:
Fix screen shot issue.  Currently doesn't work.
Refine palette hue spectrum a little more to get better color harmonies.
Calculate more exact inverse function for RGB-to-RYB.
Make a help file?

## Vestigal code
There's some functions I have commented out but work fine if you want to use them and find a place for them on the screen, like an alternative rectangular color picker.
